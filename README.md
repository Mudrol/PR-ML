Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.

Folder H2 includes several classification techniques that are used to classify
the CIFAR-10 dataset. The algorithms used are:
	1-NN
	Bayesian
	MLP

The algorithms are first used to train the system from training data, and
then classifying another set of images. Techniques used for training data 
include
	mvnpdf
	image splitting
